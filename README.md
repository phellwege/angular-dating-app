### What I learned

As my first Angular project I learned a great deal.

```css
/* codeblock here */
```


```js
// codeblock here
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has always been one of my go to's for any project that I have a minor question on.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stack overflow is an amazing resource where most of the questions that you could possibly have, have already been answered.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Mozilla is one of the most well written and easiest to digest sources of documentation available. I highly Recommend.
